# Intellectual Bottle Recycle Bin
Group Member: Shimei Qiu, Yuni Xie, and Yeting Bao.

Create an intellectual bottle recycle bin for the recycling department near your place. Once you drop a bottle into the special bin, the screen besides it will show its material. 
We use the acoustic sensing technology to collect the echoes when a bottle is drops into a box, and apply machine learning method to recognize the sound made from which material.
